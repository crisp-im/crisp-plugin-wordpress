Beautiful live chat and live support for your product

== Description ==

Crisp is a freshly new alternative to existing bulky live chat platforms, which focuses on:

- Chat experience (our name comes from that, support must be crispy for your visitors)
- Email to chat and chat to email (in case either the visitor or operator gets offline, we forward messages to email - you can reply directly to the email we send, and the messages will be sent back to chat - this is completely transparent)
- File sharing (via chat, and via email, as attachment)
- Simple operator collaboration (everything is realtime in apps)
- See what visitors type in real-time, so that you can plan your reply faster (makes the chat experience magic for visitors, since it's replies come so fast)
- Operator Apps (Web app is here ; Desktop apps coming soon, Mobile apps coming soon)
